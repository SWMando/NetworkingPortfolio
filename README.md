# My Networking Portfolio

In this portfolio you can see which labs I have done so far, and it can help you understand my potential skill set as well knowledge regarding the CCNA and partially CCNP ENCOR, both of which were covered in my university.

The repo will include 4 folders:
- CCNA 1
- CCNA 2
- CCNA 3
- CCNP ENCOR
- Computer Network Security

Each will contain one folder per lab. Inside that folder you can find the `.pkt` file which is the lab itself done in Cisco Packet Tracer, the pictures related to the lab and the `README.md` file which includes my overview and somesort of explanation of the lab.

All of these courses were covered in Tallinn University of Technology during my studies for Bachelor's of Cyber Security Engineering. Our University has lab room with real Cisco equipment and all of the labs were done in there for hands on experience. As a proof of that here is the link -> [IT College](https://taltech.ee/en/itcollege/labs)

My goal is to redo all possible labs in Cisco Packet Tracer.
